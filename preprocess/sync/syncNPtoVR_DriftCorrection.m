%% CORRECT FOR DRIFT BETWEEN IMEC AND NIDAQ BOARDS
% TWO-PART CORRECTION
% 1. Get sync pulse times relative to NIDAQ and Imec boards.  
% 2. Quantify difference between the two sync pulse times and correct in
% spike.st. 
% PART 1: GET SYNC TIMES RELATIVE TO EACH BOARD
% We already loaded most of the NIDAQ data above. Here, we access the sync
% pulses used to sync Imec and NIDAQ boards together. The times a pulse is
% emitted and registered by the NIDAQ board are stored in syncDatNIDAQ below.
syncDatNIDAQ=datNIDAQ(1,:)>1000;
% convert NIDAQ sync data into time data by dividing by the sampling rate
ts_NIDAQ = strfind(syncDatNIDAQ,[0 1])/sync_sampling_rate; 
% ts_NIDAQ: these are the sync pulse times relative to the NIDAQ board
% Now, we do the same, but from the perspective of the Imec board. 
LFP_config = dir(fullfile(spike_dir,'*.lf.meta'));
LFP_config = fullfile(LFP_config.folder,LFP_config.name);
LFP_file = dir(fullfile(spike_dir,'*.lf.bin'));
LFP_file = fullfile(LFP_file.folder,LFP_file.name);
dat=textscan(fopen(LFP_config),'%s %s','Delimiter','=');
names=dat{1};
vals=dat{2};
loc=contains(names,'imSampRate');
lfp_sampling_rate=str2double(vals{loc});
% for loading only a portion of the LFP data
fpLFP = fopen(LFP_file);
fseek(fpLFP, 0, 'eof'); % go to end of file
fpLFP_size = ftell(fpLFP); % report size of file
fpLFP_size = fpLFP_size/(2*384); 
fclose(fpLFP);
% get the sync pulse times relative to the Imec board
fpLFP=fopen(LFP_file);
fseek(fpLFP,384*2,0);
ftell(fpLFP);
datLFP=fread(fpLFP,[1,round(fpLFP_size/4)],'*int16',384*2); % this step used to take forever
fclose(fpLFP);
syncDatLFP=datLFP(1,:)>10; 
ts_LFP = strfind(syncDatLFP,[0 1])/lfp_sampling_rate;
% ts_LFP: these are the sync pulse times relative to the Imec board
% PART 2: TIME CORRECTION
lfpNIDAQdif = ts_LFP - ts_NIDAQ(1:size(ts_LFP, 2)); % calculate the difference between the sync pulse times
fit = polyfit(ts_LFP, lfpNIDAQdif, 1); % linear fit 
correction_slope = fit(1); % this is the amount of drift we get per pulse (that is, per second)
% save the old, uncorrected data as sp.st_uncorrected and save the new,
% corrected data as sp.st (as many of your analyses are using sp.st).
sp.st_uncorrected = sp.st; % save uncorrected spike times (st)
st_corrected = sp.st - sp.st * correction_slope; % in two steps to avoid confusion
sp.st = st_corrected; % overwrite the old sp.st
